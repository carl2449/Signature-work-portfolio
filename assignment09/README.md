This was a project for the course Data Structures Using Object-Oriented Design. All projects for this course involved implementing a specific data structure, often built from a custom prefabricated structure. In this case, the CiscHashSet (located in src/main/java/edu/ust/cisc) is an implementation of the already built CiscCollection in the same folder. As the name suggests, this project involved the creation of a hash set structure that uses linear probing to handle collisions. The hash set in this case is basically a Java array that can store Objects. The index that an Object is placed in the array is first determined by the result of a hash function with the value of the Object as an input. If that index is already occupied, the program searches along the rest of the array for a space that is neither occupied by a value currently nor formerly (represented by the REMOVED value). Before adding the object, it is first checked whether or not the hash set is at maximum load capacity. If so, the array is replaced with a larger array, with all of the values being re-added.
