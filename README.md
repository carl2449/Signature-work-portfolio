The future feels uncertain, particularly with regards to labor. For obvious reasons, jobs over the past couple years have seen a shift towards a more remote environment. While of course more hands-on jobs like agriculture don't have much of a remote substitute, this shift seems to particularly fit with jobs in the realm of computer science. If you previously worked primarily on a computer in an office, chances are you will likely be able to do the same work on a computer at home without too much of an issue. 

However, these jobs still require collaboration, and to put it simply, discussing matters via Zoom is not quite as intuitive as communicating face-to-face. Despite this, I feel it can be overcome. One of the projects here was completed almost entirely as a result of meeting through Zoom, and it has been one of the more rewarding programming experiences for me.

Even disregarding the recent WFM shift, another more long-term change is the increasing digitization of how we interact with the world. This means more web-based interaction. An ethical response to this involves designing web pages in a way that is intuitive rather than cumbersome, taking into consideration some needs that users might have. For example, blind people might use certain reading equipment that revolves around the way that a website is structured. Designing a website well involves taking this need into consideration. This digitization shift also involves well-informed decisions for storing data and the structures for which to do so.

More details about the projects can be found in the README.md files of each project's directory.
