The future feels uncertain, particularly with regards to labor. For obvious reasons, jobs over the past couple years have seen a shift towards a more remote environment. While of course more hands-on jobs like agriculture don't have much of a remote substitute, this shift seems to particularly fit with jobs in the realm of computer science. If you previously worked primarily on a computer in an office, chances are you will likely be able to do the same work on a computer at home without too much of an issue. 



More details about the projects can be found in the README.md files of each project's directory.
