This was the first big project for my Web Development course, requiring us to make a personal website consisting of at least four pages: a homepage, a page talking about projects we have worked on in previous classes/internships, a resume page, and a page showcasing fun facts about us. Naturally, this requires basic knowledge about HTML, but receiving a basic passing grade for the project also required implementing a sensible CSS style to be applied to all four pages. This website also contains the features needed for a full A grade on the project's rubric, namely certain web design practices such as using CSS media queries for making the site suitable for viewing on a mobile device and having links to external sites open in a new tab. All in all, completing this project required not only an understanding of the basic functionality of HTML and CSS, but also an awareness of the best general practices in web design.
