    <p>Hello there! The name's Duran, pronounced like the 80s band. I'm planning on
    double majoring in Computer Science and Music. Both computers and music have been
    part of my life as long as I can remember, so it seemed fitting. I also hope to
    finish a Recording Arts minor so I can learn more about music production, since I
    hope to get involved with music as a career. You can learn more about that <a href="fun.html">here</a>.</p>
