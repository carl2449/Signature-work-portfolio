    <h2>KUST Radio</h2>
    <p>Prior to the pandemic, I had a weekly show on our university's radio station, <a href="https://kustradio.com/" target="_blank">KUST</a>.
    My show, <em>Just Wavy Air</em>, mainly consisted of music in the indie sphere, but I'll dip my toes into different genres from
    time to time. I'm currently not recording for at least this semester, but you can still check out archived shows
    on <a href="https://mixlr.com/kust-radio/showreel/" target="_blank">KUST's Mixlr page</a>. Anything with
    "Just Wavy Air" in the title is me.</p>

    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>Music has been a significant part of my life for as long as I can remember. I started piano when I was
    around 6, and I started guitar a few years after. Guitar in particular is something that has stuck with me. Singing
    with it is one of life's greatest treasures to me.</p>

    <p>In addition to performing, I am also an avid listener of whatever music I can find. My tastes basically align
    with what I play on <em>Just Wavy Air</em>, but below is a chart of my favorite albums to get a better idea.</p>

    <p>While music is something that has permeated my life as long as I can remember, it has only been
    relatively recently that I have worked on music of my own. Right now, I'm making
    music under the name Silverprint. I currently have only one track published on Bandcamp, but
    I hope to make more stuff in the near future. In addition to writing my own music, I have contributed guitar
    parts to a couple songs by Patricia Taxxon, which you can listen to below.</p>
