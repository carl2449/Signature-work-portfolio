    <h2>2016 High School Rube Goldberg Contest</h2>
    <p>During my sophomore year of high school, our physics class was split into teams
    to compete in that year's high school Rube Goldberg contest, where the last step was to open
    an umbrella. My team built a machine themed around sci-fi, as the picture below shows. We
    won second place at regionals, meaning we advanced to the final contest in Wisconsin.
    We didn't really stand out performance-wise in that round, but it was still a fun experience all around.</p>

    <h2>Popular Music Ensemble</h2>
    <p>In Spring 2019, I was part of the university's Popular Music Ensemble (the first one
    that they did if I remember correctly). The experience was a lot less organized than
    the Guitar Ensemble, which I have also taken part in regularly. A large part of that had
    to do with the small size. You see those six people on stage in the picture? That was everyone,
    us five and the instructor (on drums in the picture). As a result, we all had more power
    over what direction the ensemble, and the performance at the end of the semester, were going
    to take, so it felt more like a project than any other musical group experience I've had here
    at St. Thomas.</p>

    <h2>Fowler Business Concept Challenge: <em>World of Music</em></h2>
    <p>Last year, for the midterm project in our Intro to Music Business course, we were split into groups to come
    up with a business idea to help fix some issue we found with the music industry. The group I was assigned to
    came up with a Skillshare-type website for aspiring musicians to learn more about their craft of choice and
    to network with fellow musicians. Keep in mind that we didn't actually make the website. After the midterm
    presentations, we presented our business concept to the annual <a href="https://business.stthomas.edu/centers-institutes/schulze-school/student-engagement/competitions/fowler-business-concept-challenge/" target="_blank">
    Fowler Business Concept Challenge</a> held here at St. Thomas.</p>
