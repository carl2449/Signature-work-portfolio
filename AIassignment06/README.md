This was a project for my Artificial Intelligence course revolving around learning from examples and decision trees. The DecisionTree class in src/main/java/dinner/learn takes a list of examples (revolving around what to have for dinner) and attributes (e.g. day of the week, whether one has leftover, whether one has pizza, whether one already ate pizza this week, etc.), determines which attribute is the "most important", splits the list of examples grouping it by that attribute, then repeats this recursively with each branch (depth-first) until all of the attributes have been exhausted. A string representation of the tree is printed out upon running the class.
